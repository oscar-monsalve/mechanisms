# Mechanisms: theoretical analysis

This repository contains theoretical analysis for the position, velocity, and acceleration and jerk for
mechanisms as the four-bar linkage and cam mechanisms.


## theoretical analysis of the four-bar linkage

### Position

The position of the four-bar linkage is determined by the following equations:

$\theta_{3_{1,2}} = 2\arctan(\frac{-B\pm \sqrt{B^2-4AC}}{2A})$
